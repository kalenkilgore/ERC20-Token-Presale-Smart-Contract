# ERC20 Token Presale & ICO Smart Contract | Ethereum Crowdsale Platform

Forked from (https://github.com/BTC415/
ERC20-Token-Presale-smart-contract). I've added a front-end as well as price oracle integration.

A comprehensive ERC20 token presale and ICO platform with Chainlink price oracle integration and a user-friendly front-end interface.

## Key Improvements

This project is a fork of [the original ERC20-Token-Presale-smart-contract](https://github.com/BTC415/ERC20-Token-Presale-smart-contract) with significant improvements:

### 1. Fixed Pricing Issues with Chainlink Oracle

The original contract had manual pricing mechanisms that were prone to errors and manipulation. We've integrated Chainlink price oracles to:

- Provide accurate, real-time ETH/USD price feeds for token pricing
- Eliminate potential pricing manipulation by using decentralized oracle data
- Calculate exact token amounts based on current market rates
- Enable precise ETH-to-token conversions without relying on potentially manipulated DEX prices
- Support dynamic pricing based on reliable market data

### 2. Responsive Front-End Implementation

We've built a complete user interface that makes interacting with the presale contract intuitive:

- Wallet connection with Web3/Ethers.js integration
- Real-time display of presale metrics (hardcap, softcap, funds raised)
- Interactive token purchase interface with multiple payment options
- Token claiming functionality
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Mobile-responsive design for all device types

The front end is live here: [https://kalenkilgore.github.io/ERC20-Token-Presale-Smart-Contract/](https://kalenkilgore.github.io/ERC20-Token-Presale-Smart-Contract/)
